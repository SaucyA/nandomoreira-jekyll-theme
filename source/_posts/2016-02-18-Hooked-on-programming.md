The Hook of Programming

 


We all have a passion. An activity that we can spend countless hours at, with time seemingly not passing at all. Whether its video games, sports or cooking, seemingly everyone has something they love to do. So as a first time programmer myself, I wanted to investigate how someone can get hooked on such a complex activity that is both tedious and slow as I have friends who spend hours daily coding.

The easiest answer to this enigma is that it takes us back to our childhood roots. Programming is like a game of mouse trap. Objects have to perform their specific tasks in order for the whole contraption to work. “Adults enjoy building things” (apache) and as a result, the whole idea of putting little pieces of the puzzle together to create a running application can get people quite excited. As I dive into the world of programming I have started noticing the joy I get when my program runs according to plan without any error messages flashing across my terminal. Overall, the delight of seeing one construct something individually is a wonderful feeling– most definitely why some some are hooked.

However, building can not be the only solution. Through my first two months of coding the part of the process that I most enjoy is the constant learning of new methods. The task of coding for me has been slow, but I have improved as time has gone on. Now, I can ‘git push’ without thinking about it, when before it seemed like a travail. An important part of programming, especially to a beginner is that you are “always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task” (grok2). Learning from mistakes is always a fulfilling process and is an amazing way to monitor improvement at an activity. When you are constantly getting better and better at an activity, there is no doubt in my mind you can get infatuated with programming. While some say mastering an activity is their desire, the majority of people care more about constant improvement. 

In total, there is no one reason why programmers are crazy about their task. User Michael Hart said, “I would encourage you to look into working on programs that can help you in every day life” (stackoverflow) when asked on how to make programming a more rewarding experience. Whatever approach you take to try and enjoy coding to the max, it is important to treat it as you would any other activity. Know that there will be challenges in the beginning, but as you progress, the greater risks you take will be even that much more rewarding.
