Computer Take Over

Ever since the industrial revolution in the late 19th century, people noticed that machinery had the capability of doing tasks previously that belonged to human. Charles Pierce wrote in the very first American Journal of Psychology that “logical machines would someday reproduce the systematic and rational aspects of human thought even though they could never duplicate the complex essence of a human being” (onlinelibrary.wiley).  It is a scary thought that far before the internet was created, people were predicting how large a role machines would play in peoples lives. 
	
As computers began to grow throughout the 20th century, psychologists and computer scientists alike began to see what behaviors computers could do in place of humans. General Motors in 1968 made it a huge goal to successfully simulate the human thought process on a computer. Professor Edward Feigenbaum of Cal-Berkley was doing groundbreaking research on the topic, work way before his time. During his speech on August 23, 1963, Dr. Feigenbaum summarized what he was working on when he said,

	“To summarize, it is postulated that there is enough of a similarity, at the information processing level, between the kinds of information processes that we can program for a computer and the kinds of information processes humans use, that we can construct models (at this level) which will do a good of predicting human behavior in experimental situations.”

Since this first true research on computer simulation of human behavior, the subject field has been incredibly popular. It is now an extensive field that not only simulates human behavior for shipping analytics but also in cinematic productions. 
	
Nowadays the field is attempting to really create human-like robots. Alexander Stoytchev‘s work on producing a robot that is able to learn from its surroundings is the first step for these robots to mimic the human thought process. Now it’s not only psychologists and computer scientists involved in this process, but also neurologists, electronic engineers, etc. The project is so revolutionary that everyone who has the chance to get involved seems to want to. His robot, HERB, now uses imitation learning to figure out how to handle objects by watching how people handle them. (Scientific American) 
	
As the field progresses rapidly, who knows what is to come. The idea of technology being to do everything a human scares me because what would a human do at that point? Would we have any purpose here on earth? We will see what happens in the future with this development, but if I had to make a prediction, I’d say there will be some sort of robot take over in the future.
