When you open up your internet browser and type facebook.com into your browser, what exactly are you getting yourself into? Facebook is an example of a dynamic website. A dynamic website lives up to its name and is able to adapt constantly by using “server technologies (such as PHP)” (RocketMedia) to mix countless pieces of data onto your screen. But before I go too in depth into how websites work, I should first describe the basics of a web site with a simple analogy: 

		Website : Webpage :: Book : Page	

So while Facebook is a website, your profile on Facebook would be an example of a webpage. Webpages are the building blocks of websites (Mozilla) and almost always have “/@%$&*!” at the end of their URL (the symbols can be replaced by anything). But to understand websites better, a little background of basic functions of the internet is vital. When you type facebook into your browser, “hierarchical decentralized naming system” called DNS (Domain Name System) takes those characters you’ve typed in and searches for the website’s IP address. This prevents you from having the arduous task of remembering up to twelve distinct numbers to find your favorite websites. 

But lets take it back to webpages. These webpages each contain data on them. This data can be stored in multiple languages (“HTML, CSS and JavaScript are common”[nycda]) and feature files such as JPEGs (photos) or GIFs (videos) in the language. Webpages grow as more and more code is typed. These pages can sometimes update with your new information or appear the same every time you enter {static vs. dynamic}. There is so much variability in a website that it is hard to sum it up with any one concise statement but here goes my attempt. 

A website in the accumulation of data under a singular IP address with the capability to give the client using some sort of information.
