Thinking like a Programmer

Challenging one’s self is the root of all growth. (BrainPickings) A mistake is good for you now and then as it shows you have the ability to get better. No one is perfect and there is no denying that. A fixed mindset determining your abilities before trying is no way to go into coding. Maybe your first lesson is difficult and you jump to the conclusion that “you’re not good at this”. Well I have news for you: That mindset will get you nowhere in life. The growth mindset seems simple, “your effort drives your success,” (Akaptur) but in fact many people become so caught up in results than the process that they fail to appreciate the hard work they have put in throughout if their end result is not up to par.  This is where it becomes vital to keep in mind why you are doing what you are doing (Skillcrush). Every task has a goal, but any good programmer knows that mistakes made in a task can be edited later on. When one goes about trying to make an app, there is no doubt in my mind that they would like the app to be perfect the first time through. However, the mistakes you make and then learn to fix on your first app creation will give you tools to push the limits on your next app. Hard work takes a toll on you. Doubling it with a mistake may seem like the worst thing to ever happen, but it is rather just the first step to be a good programmer. Yes, the end goal is important to a good programmer, but if the journey is a time filled with personal growth and the ability to recover after making mistakes, then the feeling when actually completing your task will be utterly amazing.
